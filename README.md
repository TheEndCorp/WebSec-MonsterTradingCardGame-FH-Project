# SemesterProjekt1

## Overview
SemesterProjekt1 is a C# project developed as part of a semester project. The project aims to create an application in C# to spawn a REST-based (HTTP) server that acts as an API for console. The frontend is an additional part of this project

## Features
- A user is a registered player with credentials (unique username, password).
- A user can manage his cards.
- A card consists of: a name and multiple attributes (damage, element type).
- A card is either a spell-card or a monster-card.
- The damage of a card is constant and does not change.
- A user has multiple cards in his stack.
- A stack is the collection of all his current cards.
- A user can buy cards by acquiring packages.
- A package consists of cards and can be acquired from the server by paying 5 virtual coins.
- Every user has 20 coins to buy 4 packages.
- The best 4 cards are selected by the user to be used in the deck.
- The deck is used in the battles against other players.
- A battle is a request to the server to compete against another user with your currently defined deck.

Users can:
- register and login to the server,
- acquire some cards,
- define a deck of monsters/spells,
- battle against another user
- compare their stats in the score-board.
- trade cards to have better chances to win (see detail description below).
- editable profile page
- security features (e.g., password hashing, token-based authentication)
- check other users information when logged in
